            <h1>THE ROYAL<br>TENENEBAUMS</h1>
            <h2>comedy | drama</h2>
                <p>Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had 
                    three children and then they separated. All 
                    three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. 
                    Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the 
                    young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased 
                    by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. 
                    Most of this was generally considered to be 
                    their father's fault. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is 
                    the story of the family's sudden, unexpected 
                    reunion one recent winter.</p>

                    Atari sets off alone in a miniature Junior-Turbo

                    assistance of a pack of newly-found mongrel 
                    friends, he begins an epic journey that will

                    needs of the many elderly women who stay there. When one

            <h2>comedy | adventure | drama</h2>
                <p>Renowned oceanographer Steve Zissou has sworn vengeance upon the rare 
                    shark that devoured a member of his crew. In 
                    addition to his regular team, he is joined on his

                    travel the sea, all too often running into pirates 
                    and, perhaps more traumatically, various figures 
                    from Zissou's past, including his estranged wife,
