                    <p class="left-1-text">Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had 
                        three children and then they separated. All 
                        three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. 
                        Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the 
                        young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased 
                        by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. 
                        Most of this was generally considered to be 
                        their father's fault. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is 
                        the story of the family's sudden, unexpected 
                        reunion one recent winter.</p>

                        Fiennes). Zero, a junior lobby boy, becomes Gustave's friend 
                        and protege. Gustave prides himself on providing first-class 
                        service to the hotel's guests, including satisfying the sexual 
                        needs of the many elderly women who stay there. When one 
                        of Gustave's lovers dies mysteriously, Gustave finds himself
                         the recipient of a priceless painting and the chief suspect
